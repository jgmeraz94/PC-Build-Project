# Personal PC Projects
Personal projects involving PC assembly, hardware troubleshooting, and system restoration.

## Overview
This repository documents my personal experience building, troubleshooting, and maintaining desktop computers. These hands-on projects have helped develop my skills in hardware compatibility, OS installation, and system optimization.

## Building a PC: Gaming/Desktop Workstation
- Specs: Intel i7 9700K, 2070 Nvidia RTX, 1tb SSD, 4tb HDD, 32GB DDR4 RAM, Corsair AIO, 850W gold rated moduler PSU, ASROCK Mobo, Windows 10 
- 
- Tasks:
 - Selected and assembled all compatible components (CPU, GPU, motherboard, RAM, PSU, storage, and case).
- Performed full cable management to ensure proper airflow and clean system layout.
- Verified system POST (Power-On Self-Test) and accessed BIOS to configure initial settings.
- Selected the correct boot drive and installed Windows as the primary operating system.
- Downloaded and installed the latest drivers for the GPU, chipset, and network components to ensure full hardware functionality.
- Fine-tuned GPU and CPU settings for optimal performance and thermal efficiency using manufacturer utilities.

## Tools & Skills Used

- Hardware compatibility planning
- Cable management and system assembly
- BIOS configuration and troubleshooting
- Windows installation and configuration
- Driver installation and system optimization
- GPU/CPU tuning and performance testing

## What I Learned

- How to identify and resolve POST issues
- BIOS navigation and hardware recognition
- Importance of thermal management and component placement
- How driver updates directly affect performance and stability

## PC troubleshoot and repair: Family PC Repair
### Overview
This entry documents my process troubleshooting and resolving a hardware issue on a family member's non-functioning desktop PC. The system would shut off during boot, which required a step-by-step analysis of potential hardware faults and referencing motherboard diagnostics to isolate the issue.

### Issue
- The PC would power on briefly and then shut off automatically before completing POST.
- No video output and no access to BIOS.

### Troubleshooting Process

1. **Physical Inspection**
   - Checked for loose or disconnected cables inside the case to rule out power shorts or poor contact.
   - Reseated all internal components including the GPU, RAM, and power connections.

2. **Diagnostics**
   - Observed motherboard diagnostic LEDs; one indicator light remained on.
   - Referenced the motherboard’s user manual (online via phone) to decode the error light — it indicated a RAM issue.

3. **Resolution**
   - Removed and replaced the faulty RAM with a known working module.
   - System successfully passed POST and booted into BIOS.

### Tools & Skills Used

- Hardware diagnostics using onboard indicators
- Component isolation and testing
- Reference and interpretation of manufacturer documentation
- Static-safe hardware handling
- Communication with the system owner to confirm symptoms and resolution

### Outcome
The system was restored to working order after RAM replacement. The process reinforced my skills in methodical troubleshooting and using documentation to identify and solve hardware issues.
